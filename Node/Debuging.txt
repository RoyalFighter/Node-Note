// go too network to see status code to find which 
error is ocuring in code

//if on response cannot post then its url mistake hence check url
//response if its  not sucess then its is called validate error
for eg in our code if we define input feild as texxt for number and passed number in form filling process then we get that error 

//if api is not showing in this case you can console log data
//suggestion
dont create many input feild so to enconter this
create only one use state
